# Custom Rules
To add a background add it to the section where you have the slug

```
---
slug: "/lots"
title: "My Page Title"
date: "2024-01-01"
background: "../images/lotbackground.png"
---
```

# Syntax 
**Markdown extended**

To start a section you do this:
[Section[PENNSYLVANIA]]

To end a section you do this:
[End[PENNSYLVANIA]]

You need [Section[X]] to start and [End[X]] to end, and that is the only way for that to be parsed as a section. Other than that, like [God] isn't a section/div thing.

To add image descriptions, use: This only works for level3 pages
[[ImageDesc]This is the description of the image]
